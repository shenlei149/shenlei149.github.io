In this session we learn a number of useful techniques for computing and manipulating Fourier series. We will also see some ways to get a new Fourier series from a given one, including the use of shifts, differentiation and integration. These can provide calculation shortcuts: if we already have worked out a Fourier series, we can find the coefficients of the series for a related function without having to use the integral formulas again.
