**Translation invariance.** If $p(D)$ is a constant coefficient differential operator and $p(D)x=q(t)$, then $p(D)y=q(t-c)$, where $y(t)=x(t-c)$.  
This is the "time invariance" of p(D). Here is an example of its use.

**Example.** Suppose that we know that $x_p(t)=\sqrt2\sin (t/2-\pi/4)$ is a solution to the DE
$$2x''+x'+x=\sin (t/2)$$
Find a solution $y_p$ to 
$$2x''+x'+x=\sin (t/2-\pi/3)$$
**Solution.** By translation invariance, we have immediately that
$$y_p=\sqrt2\sin (t/2-\pi/4-\pi/3)=\sqrt2\sin (t/2-7\pi/12)
