## Differential Equations
The content is from [MIT 18.03 SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011)

I did the following changes:
* Added some proofs, such as Convolution Associativity in 2702, the original text is "xxx...yyy...zz. (left as an exercise)", and I wrote the proof; Exercise in 0304.
* For some proofs and exercises, I added some steps to make it easier for me to understand(3610);
* Fixed some typos, for instance, 3506 1.ii; maybe I introduced some new typos

## A Walk Through Combinatorics
内容来自[A Walk Through Combinatorics - An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Walk-Through-Combinatorics-Introduction-Enumeration/dp/9813237457/)，该书是[MIT 18.314](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-314-combinatorial-analysis-fall-2014/syllabus/)的指定参考书。  
我基本意译了整本书的正文内容，且
* 补充了一些留给读者的证明或者思考
* 对于一些作者认为显然而我花了些时间看明白的地方做了补充
* 对于部分个人不太懂得地方（证明、习题等），在[Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/761275/leo-shen)求助并做补充
