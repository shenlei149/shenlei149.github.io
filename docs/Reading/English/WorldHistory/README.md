The World's History, 5th edition, Howard Spodek.

## Why History?
|  |  |
|--|--|
| The professional historian and the student of an introductory course often seem to pass each other on different tracks. For the professional, nothing is more fascinating than history. For the student, particularly one in a compulsory course, the whole enterprise often seems a bore. The introductory text is designed to help the student to understand and share the fascination of the historian. It will also remind professors of their original attraction to history, before they began the specialization that has almost certainly marked their later careers. Furthermore, it encourages student and professor to explore together the history of the world and the significance of this study. | 专业历史学家与修读入门课程的学生往往看似在不同的轨道上擦肩而过。对专业人士而言，没有什么比历史更令人着迷；而对于学生，尤其是那些修读必修课的学生来说，这整门学问往往显得枯燥乏味。这本入门教材旨在帮助学生理解并分享历史学家对历史的那份着迷。同时，它也能唤起教授们对历史最初的热爱，回想起在开始专业化研究之前的初心——而这种专业化几乎必然贯穿了他们后来的职业生涯。此外，本书还鼓励学生和教授共同探索世界历史以及这项研究的意义。 |

| Professional historians love their field for many reasons. History offers perspective and guidance in forming a personal view of human development. It teaches the necessity of seeing many sides of issues. It explores the complexity and interrelationship of events and makes possible the search for patterns and meaning in human life. | 专业历史学家热爱这一领域，原因有很多。历史为构建关于人类发展的个人见解提供了视角和指引。它教会我们必须从多方面看待问题。它探索事件的复杂性及其相互关系，让人们得以探寻人类生活中的规律与意义。 |
| | |
| Historians love to debate - the challenge of demonstrating that their interpretations of the pattern and significance of events are the most accurate and the most satisfying in their fit between the available data and theory. Historians also love the detective work of the profession, whether it is searching through old archives, uncovering and using new sources of information, or reinterpreting long-ignored sources. In recent years historians have turned, for example, to oral history, old church records, files of photographs, cave paintings, individual census records, and reinterpretation of mythology. | 历史学家热衷于辩论——这种挑战在于论证他们对事件规律及意义的诠释是最准确的，且在现有数据与理论的契合度方面是最令人信服的。历史学家也热爱这一行里的“侦探工作”，无论是翻阅陈旧的档案，发掘并利用新的史料，还是重新解读长期被忽视的文献。例如，近年来，历史学家们已将目光投向了口述历史、古老的教会记录、照片档案、洞穴壁画、个人人口普查记录以及对神话传说的重新解读等领域。 |
| | |
| Historical records are not simply lists of events, however. They are the means by which historians develop their interpretation of those events. Because interpretation differs, there is no single historical record, but various narrations of events each told from a different perspective. Therefore the study of history is intimately linked to the study of values, the values of the historical actors, of the historians who have written about them, and of the students engaged in learning about them. | 然而，历史记录绝非仅仅是事件的罗列。它们是历史学家借以构建对这些事件之解读的媒介。由于解读方式各异，因此不存在唯一的历史记录，而是存在对事件的多种叙述，每一种叙述都源自不同的视角。因此，历史研究与价值观的研究密不可分——这既包括历史亲历者的价值观，也包括记录这些历史的历史学家的价值观，还包括正在研习这些历史的学生的价值观。 |
| | |
| Professional historians consider history to be the king of disciplines. Synthesizing the concepts of fellow social scientists in economics, politics, anthropology, sociology, and geography, historians create a more integrated and comprehensive interpretation of the past. Joining with their colleagues in the humanities, historians delight in hearing and telling exciting stories that recall heroes and villains, the low-born and the high, the wisdom and the folly of days gone by. Increasingly, history also includes the history of science - its discoveries, its methods, and its implications for philosophy, technology, and human life. This fusion of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences gives the study of history its range, depth, significance, and pleasure. Training in historical thinking provides an excellent introduction to understanding change and continuity in our own day as well as in the past. | 专业历史学家视历史学为众学科之首。通过融汇经济学、政治学、人类学、社会学和地理学等社会科学领域同僚的理念，历史学家构建出对过去更为整合、全面的解读。历史学家还与人文科学领域的同仁联手，乐于聆听并讲述那些激动人心的故事，重现往昔的英雄与恶徒、卑微与显赫、智慧与愚昧。此外，历史学的范畴也日益囊括了科学史——包括科学发现、科学方法，及其对哲学、技术和人类生活的影响。这种社会科学、人文科学与自然科学的融合，赋予了历史研究以广度、深度、意义和乐趣。历史思维的训练，为理解当今及过去的变迁与延续提供了绝佳的入门途径。 |

## Why World History?

| Why specifically world history? Why should we teach and study world history, and what should be the content of such a course? | 为什么特别是世界史？我们为什么要教授和学习世界史？这样一门课程的内容又应当包含什么？ |
| | |
| First, world history is a good place to begin for it is new field for professor and student alike. Neither its content nor its pedagogy is yet fixed. Many of existing textbooks on the market still have their origins in the study of Western Europe, with segments added to cover the rest of the world. World History as the study of the interrelationships of all regions of the world, seen from the many perspectives of the different peoples of the earth, is till virgin territory. | 首先，世界史是一个很好的起点，因为无论对教授还是学生而言，它都是一个崭新的领域。其内容和教学方法都尚未定型。市场上现有的许多教科书仍然立足于西欧研究，只是增添了一些章节来涵盖世界其他地区。而作为一门从地球上不同民族的多种视角出发、研究世界各地区相互关系的学科，世界史仍然是一块未被开垦的处女地。|
| pedagogy: the study of the methods and activities of teaching. 教学法，教育学。 |

Second, for citizens of multicultural, multiethnic nations such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, and India, and of many other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and most nations of the European Union, which are moving in that direction, a world history course offers the opportunity to gain an appreciation of the national and cultural origins of all their diverse fellow citizens. In this way, the study of world history may help to strengthen the bonds of national citizenship.

Third, as the entire world becomes a single unit for interaction, it becomes an increasingly appropriate subject for historical study. The new reality of global interaction in communication, business, politics, religion, culture, and ecology has helped to generate the new academic subject of world history.

### Organization and Approach
The text, like the year-long course, links chronology, themes, and geography in eight units, or Parts, of study. The Parts move progressively along a time line from the emergence of early humans to the present day. Each Part emphasizes a single theme - for example, urbanization or religion or migration - and students learn to use them all to analyze historical events and to develop a grasp of the chronology of human development. The final chapter employs all the themes developed in the first seven Parts and adds an additional one, identity - personal, group, national, and global - as tools for understanding the history of our own times.

* chronology: the order in which a series of events happened, or a list or explanation of these events in the order in which they happened. 按事件发生的年代排列的顺序；（大事）年表。

## New to the Fifth Edition
Each chapter of the book has been reviewed and revised for this new edition, to accommodate new scholarship and in response to reviewer comments. The final two chapters, dealing with the contemporary world, have been extensively revised.

The pedagogical features have been carefully examined, and a completely new design makes it easy for students to find special features, such as the How Do We Know? boxes. The Turning Point boxes and Part openers have been revised, rewritten, and combined into one for all Parts.

* pedagogical: relating to the methods and theory of teaching. 教学法的，教育学的。

## Content Changes
Within each Part, material has been updated, revised, and added. Examples of some of the more notable changes and additions include: Substantial additions to the discussion of the DNA genetic record; additional material on the Aryans and the Indus valley settlers; discussion of recent archaeological discoveries in China; expanded coverage of agricultural villages; new material on Theodora, wife of the emperor Justinian; updated scholarship on the history of the Jewish people; new scholarship on the slave trade to the Americas; consideration of Russian migration to the west coast of the New World, via the Bering Straits and Alaska.

* Aryan: belonging or relating to a group of white people with pale hair and blue eyes, believed by Nazis to be better than other groups.（尤指浅色头发、蓝眼睛、被纳粹认为是最优等人种的）雅利安人的，北欧日耳曼人的。
* Indus valley: 印度河谷。

In updating the book to cover the events of contemporary history, we have added new materials to reflect new developments. These include: Breakthroughs in genetically modified crops; new ideas about the morality of using animals, especially chimpanzees, in research; coverage of the world economic collapse of 2008 and the nature of the recovery that began about 2012/13; discussion of the so-called Arab Spring; information on the Naxalite revolts in the tribal areas of India; material on globalization; updates in ecological technology and reliance on petrofuels; material on WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, and Edward Snowden; the public humanitarian activism of rock stars such as Bono; and the significance of the early influence of Pope Francis I on Roman Catholic Church.

* chimpanzee: a small, very intelligent African ape with black or brown fur. 黑猩猩。
* activism: the use of direct and noticeable action to achieve a result, usually a political or social one.（通常指为达到政治或社会目的而采取各种手段的）激进主义，行动主义。

### Chapter-by-Chapter Revisions
Chapter One, on human origins, substantially modifies and adds to the discussion of the DNA genetic record.

Chapter Two expands coverage of agricultural villages. Material has been added on family life, village life, treatment of graves, and the role of women. The discussion of Hammurabi's Code has been enhanced.

Chapter Three adds material on recent archaeological discoveries at Huanbei and in the Anyang region of China. Coverage has been added on Eurasian immigrants to the New World and on the peoples in and urbanization of the Andes Mountains. A new excerpt from the *Popol Vuh* has been included.

Chapter Six includes new information on Theodora, wife of Emperor Justinian.

Chapter Ten includes updated scholarship on the history of the Jewish people material on early Christian attitudes to sexuality, beginning with Jesus' early follower Paul, and leading to the later ban on priests marrying.

Chapter Eleven's section on the Crusades has been expanded and updated to reflect recent scholarship.

* Crusades: one of the religious wars (= crusades) fought by Christians, mostly against Muslims in Palestine, in the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 17th centuries. 十字军东征。

Chapter Twelve has been reorganized chronologically and geographically, and now moves from the general introduction to the specifics of trade in the Indian Ocean and Asia, then to Africa, and finally to the Americas. The section on the Mongol Empire has been revised and expanded, and indicates the reasons that many historians now call the Mongol Empire, and its trade routes, the marker of the beginning of the modern world.

Chapter Fourteen adds material on the inflation caused by the tans-Pacific silver trade. A new section discusses the Thirty Years War. Coverage has been added of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre and Cardinal Richelieu. Material has been added on the rule and achievements of Catherine the Great. The section on the Ottoman Empire has been expanded, and material has been added on the *millet* system.

* millet: a plant that is similar to grass, or the small seeds from this plant that can be eaten. 黍，稷；小米，粟。

## Special Features
* Learning Objectives now appear at the beginning of each chapter, and are repeated in question from under the relevant section headings and in tabs down the side of each page as reminders, before being answered at the end of each chapter, to encourage students to consider their own reading of the chapter.
* The Introduction to the book describes the key themes of the text and the methods historians use to practice their craft.
* The introductions to each of the eight Parts now include more specific key references to the chapters that follow.
* MyHistoryLab links, to primary sources, videos, images, and maps, appear throughout the chapters.
* Key Terms are listed at the each chapter for easy reference, and collected in the Glossary at the end of the book.
* Turning Point essays, some completely new for this edition, illustrate visually the connections between one Part and the next. In some cases, the Turning Points tell their own story as well, notably in the bridge into hte twenty-first century that uses the modern Olympic Games to illustrate and introduce many of the issues that are to follow. Turning Point Questions ask students to consider the material that has been presented.
* The How Do We Know? features help the student to understand how historians use evidence, both textual and visual, to interpret the past.
* This edition also continues the emphasis on the use of primary sources, for this is the kind of material from which the historical record is argued and fashioned. Most chapters have tow or more Source boxes, which have been colored purple in this edition to stand out.
* The Suggested Readings for each chapter have been thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded to reflect current scholarship. Films, videos, and online assets have been added. Each item in the bibliography is annotated to direct students with their reading.
* Each chapter text ends with a discussion of legacies to the future, namely, What Difference Does It Make?
* Each chapter concludes with a Chapter Review, where the reader is given answers to the Learning Objectives, essentially a summary of the most important material covered in each main heading.

### New Layout and Design
Readers will notice cleaner design of box features. The format has reverted to the original taller page size so that the text and pictures have a little more room to breathe.

### Maps and  Illustrations
To aid the student, extensive, clear, and informative charts and maps represent information graphically and geographically. A wide range of illustrations, most in color, supplements the written word. For the fifth edition we have added more than 50 new illustrations.
