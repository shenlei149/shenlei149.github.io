The World's History, 5th edition, Howard Spodek.

## Why History?
|  |  |
|--|--|
| The professional historian and the student of an introductory course often seem to pass each other on different tracks. For the professional, nothing is more fascinating than history. For the student, particularly one in a compulsory course, the whole enterprise often seems a bore. The introductory text is designed to help the student to understand and share the fascination of the historian. It will also remind professors of their original attraction to history, before they began the specialization that has almost certainly marked their later careers. Furthermore, it encourages student and professor to explore together the history of the world and the significance of this study. | 专业历史学家与修读入门课程的学生往往看似在不同的轨道上擦肩而过。对专业人士而言，没有什么比历史更令人着迷；而对于学生，尤其是那些修读必修课的学生来说，这整门学问往往显得枯燥乏味。这本入门教材旨在帮助学生理解并分享历史学家对历史的那份着迷。同时，它也能唤起教授们对历史最初的热爱，回想起在开始专业化研究之前的初心——而这种专业化几乎必然贯穿了他们后来的职业生涯。此外，本书还鼓励学生和教授共同探索世界历史以及这项研究的意义。 |
| Professional historians love their field for many reasons. History offers perspective and guidance in forming a personal view of human development. It teaches the necessity of seeing many sides of issues. It explores the complexity and interrelationship of events and makes possible the search for patterns and meaning in human life. | 专业历史学家热爱这一领域，原因有很多。历史为构建关于人类发展的个人见解提供了视角和指引。它教会我们必须从多方面看待问题。它探索事件的复杂性及其相互关系，让人们得以探寻人类生活中的规律与意义。 |
| Historians love to debate - the challenge of demonstrating that their interpretations of the pattern and significance of events are the most accurate and the most satisfying in their fit between the available data and theory. Historians also love the detective work of the profession, whether it is searching through old archives, uncovering and using new sources of information, or reinterpreting long-ignored sources. In recent years historians have turned, for example, to oral history, old church records, files of photographs, cave paintings, individual census records, and reinterpretation of mythology. | 历史学家热衷于辩论——这种挑战在于论证他们对事件规律及意义的诠释是最准确的，且在现有数据与理论的契合度方面是最令人信服的。历史学家也热爱这一行里的“侦探工作”，无论是翻阅陈旧的档案，发掘并利用新的史料，还是重新解读长期被忽视的文献。例如，近年来，历史学家们已将目光投向了口述历史、古老的教会记录、照片档案、洞穴壁画、个人人口普查记录以及对神话传说的重新解读等领域。 |
| Historical records are not simply lists of events, however. They are the means by which historians develop their interpretation of those events. Because interpretation differs, there is no single historical record, but various narrations of events each told from a different perspective. Therefore the study of history is intimately linked to the study of values, the values of the historical actors, of the historians who have written about them, and of the students engaged in learning about them. | 然而，历史记录绝非仅仅是事件的罗列。它们是历史学家借以构建对这些事件之解读的媒介。由于解读方式各异，因此不存在唯一的历史记录，而是存在对事件的多种叙述，每一种叙述都源自不同的视角。因此，历史研究与价值观的研究密不可分——这既包括历史亲历者的价值观，也包括记录这些历史的历史学家的价值观，还包括正在研习这些历史的学生的价值观。 |
| Professional historians consider history to be the king of disciplines. Synthesizing the concepts of fellow social scientists in economics, politics, anthropology, sociology, and geography, historians create a more integrated and comprehensive interpretation of the past. Joining with their colleagues in the humanities, historians delight in hearing and telling exciting stories that recall heroes and villains, the low-born and the high, the wisdom and the folly of days gone by. Increasingly, history also includes the history of science - its discoveries, its methods, and its implications for philosophy, technology, and human life. This fusion of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences gives the study of history its range, depth, significance, and pleasure. Training in historical thinking provides an excellent introduction to understanding change and continuity in our own day as well as in the past. | 专业历史学家视历史学为众学科之首。通过融汇经济学、政治学、人类学、社会学和地理学等社会科学领域同僚的理念，历史学家构建出对过去更为整合、全面的解读。历史学家还与人文科学领域的同仁联手，乐于聆听并讲述那些激动人心的故事，重现往昔的英雄与恶徒、卑微与显赫、智慧与愚昧。此外，历史学的范畴也日益囊括了科学史——包括科学发现、科学方法，及其对哲学、技术和人类生活的影响。这种社会科学、人文科学与自然科学的融合，赋予了历史研究以广度、深度、意义和乐趣。历史思维的训练，为理解当今及过去的变迁与延续提供了绝佳的入门途径。 |

## Why World History?
|  |  |
|--|--|
| Why specifically world history? Why should we teach and study world history, and what should be the content of such a course? | 为什么特别是世界史？我们为什么要教授和学习世界史？这样一门课程的内容又应当包含什么？ |
| First, world history is a good place to begin for it is new field for professor and student alike. Neither its content nor its pedagogy is yet fixed. Many of existing textbooks on the market still have their origins in the study of Western Europe, with segments added to cover the rest of the world. World History as the study of the interrelationships of all regions of the world, seen from the many perspectives of the different peoples of the earth, is till virgin territory. | 首先，世界史是一个很好的起点，因为无论对教授还是学生而言，它都是一个崭新的领域。其内容和教学方法都尚未定型。市场上现有的许多教科书仍然立足于西欧研究，只是增添了一些章节来涵盖世界其他地区。而作为一门从地球上不同民族的多种视角出发、研究世界各地区相互关系的学科，世界史仍然是一块未被开垦的处女地。|
| pedagogy: the study of the methods and activities of teaching. 教学法，教育学。 |
| Second, for citizens of multicultural, multiethnic nations such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, and India, and of many other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and most nations of the European Union, which are moving in that direction, a world history course offers the opportunity to gain an appreciation of the national and cultural origins of all their diverse fellow citizens. In this way, the study of world history may help to strengthen the bonds of national citizenship. | 其次，对于像美国、加拿大、南非和印度这样的多文化、多民族国家的公民，以及像英国、澳大利亚和欧盟大多数国家那样正朝着这一方向发展的许多其他国家的公民来说，世界历史课程提供了一个契机，使他们能够了解并尊重其多元化同胞的民族与文化起源。通过这种方式，世界历史的学习有助于增强国家公民之间的凝聚力。 |
| Third, as the entire world becomes a single unit for interaction, it becomes an increasingly appropriate subject for historical study. The new reality of global interaction in communication, business, politics, religion, culture, and ecology has helped to generate the new academic subject of world history. | 第三，随着整个世界日益成为一个互动的整体，它也越来越适合作为历史研究的对象。通讯、商业、政治、宗教、文化和生态等领域全球互动的新现实，推动了世界历史这一新学术课题的产生。 |

### Organization and Approach
|  |  |
|--|--|
| The text, like the year-long course, links *chronology*, *themes*, and *geography* in eight units, or Parts, of study. The Parts move progressively along a time line from the emergence of early humans to the present day. Each Part emphasizes a single theme - for example, urbanization or religion or migration - and students learn to use them all to analyze historical events and to develop a grasp of the chronology of human development. The final chapter employs all the themes developed in the first seven Parts and adds an additional one, identity - personal, group, national, and global - as tools for understanding the history of our own times. | 这本教材，就像那门为期一年的课程一样，将*年代*、*主题*和*地理*这三个要素串联在八个学习单元（或称“部分”）之中。这八个部分沿着时间线逐步推进，从早期人类的出现一直讲到今天。每个部分都侧重于一个特定的主题——例如城市化、宗教或迁徙——学生将学习如何运用所有这些主题来分析历史事件，并掌握人类发展的年代脉络。最后一章不仅运用了前七个部分所阐述的所有主题，还增加了一个额外的主题——身份认同（包括个人、群体、国家和全球层面的认同），以此作为理解我们当代历史的工具。 |
| chronology: the order in which a series of events happened, or a list or explanation of these events in the order in which they happened. 按事件发生的年代排列的顺序；（大事）年表。 | |

## New to the Fifth Edition
|  |  |
|--|--|
|  Each chapter of the book has been reviewed and revised for this new edition, to accommodate new scholarship and in response to reviewer comments. The final two chapters, dealing with the contemporary world, have been extensively revised. | 本书的每一章都为这一新版本进行了审阅和修订，以纳入新的学术成果和对审稿人意见的回应。最后两章涉及当代世界的内容，更是经过了大幅度的修改。 |
| The pedagogical features have been carefully examined, and a completely new design makes it easy for students to find special features, such as the How Do We Know? boxes. The Turning Point boxes and Part openers have been revised, rewritten, and combined into one for all Parts. | 教学特色部分经过了仔细审查，全新的设计使得学生能够轻松找到诸如“我们如何知道？”（How Do We Know?）专栏等特色内容。“转折点”（Turning Point）专栏和各部分的开篇介绍也经过了修订、重写，并在所有部分中合并为一体。 |
| pedagogical: relating to the methods and theory of teaching. 教学法的，教育学的。 | |
